### Ready for the ride
Hey, comon! (ready for the ride)
Well, I know its been on your mind
I’m redy, let me get in line
You dream about it all the time, we know
The past is never far behind

And I’ve ben waiting all my life
To finally make a wish upon a star
And if you want it bad enough
Just close your eyes and dream, it’s never far
It’s standing right there where you are

Where we can dram a little bigger right now
If we open up our eyes

I’m ready fr the ride (I’m ready for the ride)
I’m ready to bring light just like the sun, yeah
Our memories are al around,
And I know we’ve only just begun

Yeah, heeeeeeey

Keep on looking up (keep on looking up)
Never forget just how far we’ve come
The memories are all around
And I know we’ve only just begun
Oh and I yeah, I’m ready for the ride
(Hey!)

It’s a new beginning
Like a brand new place
When the world is spinning
Put that smile back on your face
I’m gonna take you there, I’m gonna catch your trail
All my happy thoughts have come true
Everything I wanted is right here with you

Where we can dream a little bigger right now,
If we open up our eyes

I’m ready for the ride (I’m ready for the ride)
I’m ready to bring light just like the sun
The memories are all around
And I know we’ve only just begun

Yeah, yeeeeeeah

Keep on looking up (keep on looking up)
Never forgt just how far we’ve come
The memories are all arround
And I know we’ve only just begun
(And I know we’ve just begun)
Oh and I, yeah, I’m ready for the ride
Hey, com’on!
